Sometimes GPT-4 will write an infinite loop that runs forever. In this case, there'll be a request timeout. Using Azure login can automatically resume the running if there's a request timeout.\n## Option 1: Microsoft Azure Login (Recommended)\nUsing this method will allow Voyager to automatically resume when there's a request timeout. This is dependent on the [minecraft-launcher-lib](https://minecraft-launcher-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/microsoft_login.html#let-the-user-log-in) library.\n1. Sign in to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n2. Go to [Azure Active Directory](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).\n3. Click on the `App Registrations` tab on the left panel.\n4. Click on the `New registration` button."

Click on the `Register` button.\n7. The `Application (client) ID` will be your `client_id`.\n8. [Optional] Go to the `Certificates & Secrets` tab and click on the `New client secret` button. Fill the description by yourself. After you click `Add`, you will see your value, this will be your `secret_value`.\n9. Go to your Minecraft install location `YOUR_MINECRAFT_GAME_LOCATION/versions`, and check all the versions you have.

Select the version you want to play and start the game.\n2. Select `Singleplayer` and create a new world.\n3. Set Game Mode to `Creative` and Difficulty to `Peaceful`.\n4. After the world is created, press `Esc` and select `Open to LAN`.\n5. Select `Allow cheats: ON` and press `Start LAN World`.\n6. You will see a port number in the chat log, that is your `mc-port`, use this number to instantiate Voyager later."
