Why does the code not complete the task? What does the chat log and execution error imply?\nPlan: How to complete the task step by step. You should pay attention to Inventory since it tells what you have. The task completeness check is also based on your final inventory.\nCode:\n    1) Write an async function taking the bot as the only argument.\n    2) Reuse the above useful programs as much as possible.\n        - Use `mineBlock(bot, name, count)` to collect blocks. Do not use `bot.dig` directly."

Do not use `bot.openFurnace` directly.\n        - Use `placeItem(bot, name, position)` to place blocks. Do not use `bot.placeBlock` directly.\n        - Use `killMob(bot, name, timeout)` to kill mobs. Do not use `bot.attack` directly.\n    3) Your function will be reused for building more complex functions. Therefore, you should make it generic and reusable. You should not make strong assumption about the inventory (as it may be changed at a later time), and therefore you should always check whether you have the required items before using them. If not, you should first collect the required items and reuse the above useful programs.\n    4) Functions in the \"Code from the last round\" section will not be saved or executed. Do not reuse functions listed there.\n    5) Anything defined outside a function will be ignored, define all your variables inside your functions."

You should frequently call this before mining blocks or killing mobs. You should select a direction at random every time instead of constantly using (1, 0, 1).\n    8) `maxDistance` should always be 32 for `bot.findBlocks` and `bot.findBlock`. Do not cheat.\n    9) Do not write infinite loops or recursive functions.\n    10) Do not use `bot.on` or `bot.once` to register event listeners. You definitely do not need them.\n    11) Name your function in a meaningful way (can infer the task from the name).\nYou should only respond in the format as described below:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\n{response_format}"
