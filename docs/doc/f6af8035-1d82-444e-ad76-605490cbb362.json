Then, the resume is the same as using ours skill libraries. Just set `skill_library_dir=COMMUNITY_CKPT_DIR` where `COMMUNITY_CKPT_DIR` is the ckpt dir inside the folder you just downloaded.\n## How to Contribute\nAfter you run the learning process, you will see a checkpoint directory like:\n```\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 action\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 chest_memory.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 curriculum\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 completed_tasks.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 failed_tasks.json\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 qa_cache.json\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 vectordb\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 events\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 skill\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 code\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 catchThreeFishWithCheck.js\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 collectBamboo.js"
